<h2>Summer 2019</h2>
        <p>This was a fun summer! I stopped going to college after one semester because it was expensive and I didn't know what I wanted to do but I heard about people taking a gap year to try stuff... I ended up looking at wwoofing, where you volunteer on an organic farm in exhange for room and board, and it was pretty fun! The one I went to was near Detroit, MI and I learned about building sustainable strawbale houses. Kind of unique but really just fun! The link to that place is <a href="https://wwoofusa.org/en/host/17878-come-learn-about-strawbale-natural-building-some-gardening-and-permaculture-and-sustainable-skills"</a> </p>
