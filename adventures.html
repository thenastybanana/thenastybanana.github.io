<h2>Summer 2019</h2>
        <p>This was a fun summer! I stopped going to college after one semester because it was expensive and I didn't know what I wanted to do but I heard about people taking a gap year to try stuff... I saved $5,000 ended up looking at wwoofing, where you volunteer on an organic farm in exhange for room and board, and it was pretty fun! The one I went to was near Detroit, MI and I learned about building sustainable strawbale houses. Kind of unique but really just fun! The link to that place is <a href="https://wwoofusa.org/en/host/17878-come-learn-about-strawbale-natural-building-some-gardening-and-permaculture-and-sustainable-skills">here</a>. From there, I hitchhiked to Asheville North Carolina where I visited <a href="https://www.fireflygathering.org/">The Firefly Gathering></a>, which is skills based learning get together.. That was really fun too! Lots of weird people though! From there, I hitchhiked to Some random place in the woods in Wisconsin where they had an event called The Rainbow Gathering. I wasn't sure what it was, I kinda just went because it sounded interesting and I got a free ride there! But it was really weird, and hippies were everywhere! It lasted a week and I just wanted to go home... Wasn't my cup of tea. </p>

<h2>Fall and Winter 2020</h2>
        <p>There wasn't anything that interesting early 2020. I tried to take a few interesting college classes but I didn't know what I wanted to do so I didn't stick around. I worked a few menial labor jobs trying to find a path that I liked, and really this whole year kinda just sucked. Eventually my uncle recommended that I check out this <a href="https://www.grcc.edu/programs/job-workforce-training/workforce-training-programs/welding-metallica-scholars">Metallica Welding Scholarship</a> for welding school where I'd gain entry level skills into welding. I did that while working at a factory and then right after, I got a job in a little fab shop called The BlackSmith Shop. The name is deceiving! We weren't blacksmiths, we were welders... That was really fun and I learned all about what the trades was like. If you are a young guy going into the trades, don't give up on the job because the guys are jerks! They are just making fun of you because you are green and gullible. If they make you "hold a bucket to collect the sparks for recycling while you grind", and they are laughing at you because you actually do it, just tell em you'll bang their moms for this and move on. It's all fun and games! You'll settle into building cool stuff and gaining respect. Gotta earn it with your skills first!</p>
<h2>Spring, Summer and Fall 2021</h2>
        <p>this was a fun time! I had saved another $5,000 at this time and decided I needed another vacation! I had converted my truck into a camper with a bed whose legposts I fabricated from work, a carpet I got from a leftover carpet job, a topper I bought for $30, and a few bins from walmart. From there, I just started driving to Florida! I stopped in Asheville, NC for some time and hung out with a friend for a few weeks. Then I drove to florida and hung out on Cocoa beach for a few months, going to beaches, getting ice cream, watching rocket launches, and hanging out with my dad. That was pretty fun! The warm weather was great! I should try to upload pictures from these times! The most memorable part of this trip was when my Grandmother sat me down and showed me a few Mike Rowe clips where he said "following your passion doesn't guarantee money, and it doesn't even guarantee you'll end up in a job you'll like... but following money will get you rich, and then it can grow into your passion if you cultivate it!" Something like that... So, after that trip, I started driving back to Michigan to enroll in another welding school for more skills in the middle of that summer.. but on the way back, I stopped in Asheville again and went to a random rave in the middle of the woods. Lots of people doing drugs! AHH! Scary! Not my cup of tea.. Time to scurry home.</p>
<h2>Spring and Summer 2022</h2>
        <p>I enrolled in a welding school that lasted 6 months and was about 40 hrs per week. That was a blast. Unfortutely the friendships I made here didn't last because they seemed to start doing cocaine... NOT MY CUP OF TEA! GRRRAAAHH! But I learned some more badass skills! Once I finished, I jumped right into travel welding. It's really easy because the jobs I found were literally like entry level welding jobs that just couldn't hire anyone because no one wanted to work there... So easy money and easy work! The first place I went to was in a little town called West Bend, WI where I welded lawnmower decks. Very boring but hey, it paid, and I could afford to do fun stuff after work. I kept buying camping stuff to convert my Prius into a stealth camper so I could go on longer trips. The goal was to deck it out for adventures into the woods where I could sit in the steady flow of the woods for months, enjoying nature. Well, maybe someday lol. </p>
