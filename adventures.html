<h2>Summer 2019</h2>
        <p>This Summer was the beginning of my attempts to find adventures. I stopped going to college after one semester because it was expensive and I didn't know what I wanted to do. I heard about people taking a gap
                year to see more of the world to find out what they want to do. I saved $5,000 ended up looking at wwoofing, where you volunteer on an organic farm in exhange for room and board. The one I went to was near
                Detroit, MI and I learned about building sustainable strawbale houses. The link to that place is
                <a href="https://wwoofusa.org/en/host/17878-come-learn-about-strawbale-natural-building-some-gardening-and-permaculture-and-sustainable-skills">here</a>. From there, I hitchhiked to Asheville, North 
                Carolina where I visited <a href="https://www.fireflygathering.org/">The Firefly Gathering></a>, which is a skills based learning retreat.. From there, I hitchhiked to Some random place in the woods in
                Wisconsin where they had an event called The Rainbow Gathering.</p>
        <br>
<h2>Fall and Winter 2020</h2>
        <p>There wasn't anything that interesting early 2020. I tried to take a few college classes but I didn't know what I wanted to do so I didn't stick around. I worked a few menial labor jobs trying to find a path
                that I liked, and really this whole year was just a blur. Eventually my uncle recommended that I check out this
                <a href="https://www.grcc.edu/programs/job-workforce-training/workforce-training-programs/welding-metallica-scholars">Metallica Welding Scholarship</a> for welding school where I'd gain entry level skills
                into welding. I did that while working at a factory and then right after, I got a job in a little fab shop called The BlackSmith Shop. The name is deceiving! We weren't blacksmiths, we were welders... 
                I learned all about what the trades are like. If you are a young guy going into the trades, don't give up on the job because the guys are jerks! They are just making fun of you because you are new and 
                gullible. You'll settle into building cool stuff and gaining respect.</p>
<h2>Spring, Summer and Fall 2021</h2>
        <p>I had saved another $5,000 so I quit my job for another summer trip. I had converted my truck into a camper with a bed whose legposts I fabricated from work, a carpet I got from a leftover carpet job,
                a topper I bought for $30, and a few bins from walmart. From there, I just started driving to Florida, I stopped in Asheville, NC for some time and hung out with a friend for a few weeks. 
                Then I drove to florida and hung out near Coco Beach for a few months. I was going to beaches, getting ice cream, watching rocket launches, and hanging out with my dad.
                The warm weather was nice. The most memorable part of this trip was when my Grandmother sat me down and showed me a few Mike Rowe clips where he said "following your passion doesn't guarantee money,
                and it doesn't even guarantee you'll end up in a job you'll like... but following money can get you rich, and then it can grow into your passion if you cultivate it." Something like that... So,
                after that trip, I started driving back to Michigan to enroll in another welding school for more skills in the middle of that summer.. but on the way back, I stopped in Asheville again and went to a
                random rave in the middle of the woods for a few days. Around this time, I started realizing that the people who do hippie things aren't really my type of people because there are a lot of drugs.
                I'm glad I was able to go to these strange gap year type events because I saw so many people who were struggling from bad life decisions. Homelessness, hostility, Drug abuse, wanderlusters... 
                Amidst these strange vagabonds were creatives who were in charge of building places of community for these people. These creatives were awesome, but I don't think I want to be surrounded with what 
                they deal with. </p>
<h2>Spring and Summer 2022</h2>
        <p>I enrolled in a welding school that lasted 6 months and was about 40 hrs per week. Unfortutely the friendships I made here didn't last because they seemed to start doing cocaine. I've learned that once people
                get into that stuff, It's best to create some distance. I learned some more badass skills! Once I finished, I jumped right into travel welding. It's really easy because the jobs I found were literally 
                like entry level welding jobs that just couldn't hire anyone because no one wanted to work there. Easy money and easy work. The first place I went to was West Bend, WI. I kept buying camping stuff to 
                convert my Prius into a stealth camper. 
                into a stealth camper so I could go on longer trips.</p>
