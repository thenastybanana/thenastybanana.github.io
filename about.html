    <p>My name is Eben, I'm 24, and my current occupation is welding. I've been welding for 4 years interchangeably as a traveling mig welder or a local tig/mig welder. I have 4 days off a week with my current job and am looking to pick up more skills and jobs.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>What are my goals?</h2>
    <p>One goal is I'd like to get down to 180 lbs of lean muscle. Another is I'd like to get on a more plant based diet, either vegan or mediterranean. A third is to save up for a house to either live in or rent out. A fourth, for fun, I'd like to operate a simple lawn care business for experience on how to run a business.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I'll add more as time goes on.</p>
