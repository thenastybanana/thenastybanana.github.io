        <p>I am a full-stack software engineer. I am excited to continue growing and learning in my field. I have completed FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms course which takes about 300 hours to complete, and I've also finished the first 4 weeks of CS50. Currently, I'm working on a project with experienced developers where we are using React, next.js, DaisyUI, tailwind CSS, and JavaScript to move the blog from a shopify store to wordpress. 
            <br><br>
        My strongest language is JavaScript, but I've also used C, HTML, and CSS. I'm getting familiar with Docker and git bash. There is much more to learn as I continue to grow. 
        <br><br>
            I am so very thankful for the successful people who I've been able to connect with to teach me and get me to where I am now. Anytime I have the chance to pay it forward, I do my best to take it.
        <br><br>
        I enjoy biking, hiking, reading and dancing. It can be ethnic dancing, swing dancing, latin dancing, really anything. As a kid I did ballet for a season. I have yet to try ballroom dancing.
